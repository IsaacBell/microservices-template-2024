# Lodging Service

"Lodging" refers to any form of property - residences, workspaces, rentals, and the like. This service is intended to serve as an API for listing services - e.g. AirBnB, ApartmentFinder, or Zillow. 

Currently, CRUD is offered for listings. Plans are to support geolocation using PostGIS and Google Maps.

For an API specification, see: `api/v1/lodging/lodging.proto`.

This service's app entrypoint can be found at `app/lodging/main.go`.
